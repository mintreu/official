Mintreu Official - Implementation Review + Upgraded Plan (2026-01-29)

SUMMARY
- Project is a digital product + SaaS/API distribution platform (mothership).
- Core download flow is implemented and wired in API.
- Admin resources exist, but some are misaligned with the refactored schema.
- Frontend ads and ads API are missing.

IMPLEMENTATION SNAPSHOT (REAL CODE)
Backend
- Laravel 12.35, Filament 4, Sanctum 4, Livewire 3.
- Download flow is wired:
  - POST /api/products/{slug}/download
  - GET /api/download/{token}
  - GET /api/products/{slug}/sources
- DownloadService generates masked URLs and logs download activity.
- ProductResource exists with SourcesRelationManager.
- AdvertisementResource exists, but model namespace mismatch.
- StorageProvider/StorageCredential resources still exist, but tables dropped.

Frontend
- Nuxt app present. No AdZone component or ads fetching logic found.

DATA MODEL (CURRENT)
- products: short_description, meta, api_config, requires_auth, default_license
- product_sources: unified download sources
- licenses: type, meta, api_credential_id, plan_id, server_info
- download_logs: product_source_id + audit fields
- plans/api_endpoints/api_keys/api_usage_logs for API products

OPEN ISSUES (SEE /issues)
- ProductResource table/infolist uses deprecated columns (Issue 04)
- AdvertisementResource model namespace mismatch (Issue 05)
- Obsolete admin resources for removed tables (Issue 06)
- Ads API + AdZone missing (Issue 03)

UPGRADED PLAN (EXECUTION)
P0: Stabilize and align
- Fix ProductResource UI fields to match schema
- Fix AdvertisementResource model namespace
- Remove/hide StorageProvider & StorageCredential resources
- Add ads API + AdZone if ads are near-term revenue

P1: Revenue core
- Checkout + webhook + license issuance flow
- Customer dashboard for licenses/downloads/API keys
- Vouchers + referrals (single level)

P2: Scale and resilience
- Usage tracking, rate limiting, alerts
- Upgrade/downgrade and bundles
- Incident playbook + audit logs

RISKS
- Admin UI mismatch can cause bad data ops.
- Ads revenue path blocked until frontend/API exists.
- Legacy resources may break admin navigation.

REQUESTED FOUNDER INPUTS
- Current product list + revenue estimates
- Flagship product(s) selection
- Payment provider and refund constraints
- Target customer segment

NEXT STEPS
- Confirm which P0 fixes to execute now.
- Provide product inventory for plan sequencing.
