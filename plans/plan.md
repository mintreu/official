# Project Plan

## Backend (Laravel)

*   **Admin Panel:** A dedicated interface for administrators to manage the application.
*   **User Authentication:** Secure login for both administrators and regular users.
*   **API:** A robust API to power the frontend client, handling data for the user dashboard and public pages.

## Client (Nuxt.js)

*   **User/Customer Dashboard:** A private area for users to manage their accounts and data.
*   **Public Frontend:** The public-facing website.
*   **SPA Architecture:** The client will function as a Single Page Application (SPA), consuming data from the Laravel backend API.
