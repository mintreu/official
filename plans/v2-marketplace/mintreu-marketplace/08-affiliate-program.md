# Chapter 8: The Affiliate Program

The Mintreu Marketplace will include an affiliate program to incentivize promotion of products and expand its reach. This chapter outlines how the affiliate program will function, from tracking referrals to managing commissions and providing an affiliate dashboard.

## 8.1. How it Works: Tracking referrals and commissions.

The affiliate program will allow individuals to earn a commission by referring customers to products on the Mintreu Marketplace.

*   **Affiliate Registration**: Users can apply to become affiliates through a dedicated section in their user dashboard. Approval might be automatic or require Super Admin review.
*   **Unique Referral Links**: Each approved affiliate will receive unique referral links for the marketplace homepage, specific products, or categories. These links will embed the affiliate's ID.
*   **Cookie-Based Tracking**: Referrals will be tracked using cookies (e.g., 30-day cookie duration) to ensure affiliates receive credit even if a purchase isn't made immediately.
*   **Commission Structure**:
    *   **Global Commission Rate**: A default percentage commission set by the platform for all products (e.g., 10%).
    *   **Developer-Defined Commission**: Developers can optionally set higher commission rates for their specific products to attract more affiliates.
    *   **Tiered Commissions**: Potentially, higher commission rates for affiliates who drive more sales.
*   **Last-Click Attribution**: Typically, the last affiliate link clicked before a purchase will receive the commission.
*   **Commission Calculation**: Commissions will be calculated on the net sale amount (after any discounts and before taxes/fees).

## 8.2. The Affiliate Dashboard: Tracking clicks, sales, and earnings.

A dedicated dashboard will provide affiliates with the tools and information they need to monitor their performance.

*   **Referral Link Generator**: Easy tool to generate custom referral links for any product or page on the marketplace.
*   **Performance Overview**:
    *   Total clicks on their referral links.
    *   Number of referred sales.
    *   Conversion rates.
    *   Total earned commission (pending and paid).
*   **Detailed Sales Report**: A list of individual sales attributed to the affiliate, including product details, sale amount, and commission earned.
*   **Payout History**: Records of all commissions paid out to the affiliate.
*   **Marketing Resources**: Access to banners, product images, and promotional copy provided by developers or the platform.
*   **Settings**:
    *   Manage affiliate profile.
    *   Update payout preferences (e.g., PayPal email, bank details).
    *   View terms and conditions.
