# Main Structure Review (Cofounder Pass)

Date: 2026-02-19  
Goal: Hit 10 lakh in 6 months, go live this week.

## 1) Verdict

Current direction is mostly correct.  
Big correction needed: product boundary must be strict.

Final boundary:
1. Official = sales, billing, licensing, delivery, support control tower.
2. Product repos (Shopcore, Helpdesk, others) = hosted API engines.
3. Sellable outputs = API subscription + Nuxt frontend packs only.
4. Do not distribute backend source code to buyers.

---

## 2) What Is Strong Already

1. Shared-host mirror planning is practical and execution-friendly.
2. Multi-env (prod/demo/staging) thinking is in place.
3. Licensing and activation hardening direction exists.
4. Revenue-first bias is aligned with solo founder constraints.

---

## 3) Gaps To Fix Fast

1. Product catalog framing still too "single project heavy".
2. Niche packaging strategy was implied, not operationalized.
3. Weekly go-live plan needs hard deliverables and owner-level priorities.
4. Seeder data does not fully reflect API + frontend-only commercial model.

---

## 4) Improved Structure (Recommended)

Commercial stack:
1. `Core API Product` (monthly recurring)
2. `Nuxt Frontend Pack` (one-time, niche specific)
3. `Support/Onboarding Add-on` (optional recurring or setup fee)

Example for Shopcore:
1. Shopcore API Launch/Growth/Scale plans
2. Fashion frontend pack
3. Electronics frontend pack
4. Grocery frontend pack

This model supports:
1. recurring MRR from API
2. fast upfront cash from pack sales
3. easier upsell from one niche to multi-niche

---

## 5) Revenue Math (10 Lakh / 6 Months)

Target average: `166,667` per month.

Simple mixed target:
1. API MRR target by month 6: `120,000`
2. Frontend pack sales per month: `60,000`+
3. Onboarding/support add-ons: `20,000`+

Total steady state: `200,000`+ monthly possible if funnel is disciplined.

---

## 6) This Week Go-Live Scope (Non-Negotiable)

P0:
1. Live official product pages for Shopcore API + 3 Nuxt niche packs.
2. Trial URL + demo credentials + clear CTA.
3. Checkout -> payment -> license/API key issuance path verified.
4. Support intake channel live (ticket/email form + SLA expectation).

P1:
1. Helpdesk SaaS pre-launch page + waitlist.
2. Niche-pack comparison table.
3. Activation recovery flow docs.

P2:
1. Affiliate/referral optimization.
2. Advanced analytics dashboards.

---

## 7) Operating Principle

Do fewer things, but sellable things:
1. One API product done properly.
2. Three niche frontends ready to deploy.
3. One support path that closes buyers fast.
