## 3) Pricing Skeleton

API monthly:
1. Launch: basic quota + 1 site
2. Growth: higher quota + 3 sites
3. Scale: high quota + multi-brand support

Frontend one-time:
1. Velora Boutique (dress/fashion focus)
2. PlayNest Toy
3. HavenHaus Furniture
4. LunaMuse Women

Upsell:
1. Custom theme adaptation
2. Setup/onboarding package

Category lock model:
1. Each Nuxt variant has allow-listed categories only.
2. Non-allowed categories hidden/blocked at frontend layer.
3. Backend API remains shared and unchanged.

## 4) Niche Strategy

Core engine remains same.  
Only frontend and seed/content presets change per niche.

Niche advantages:
1. Faster client trust ("looks made for my business")
2. Faster deployment
3. Better conversion than generic demos
