Frontend packs per new API:
1. LicenseOps:
   - License seller portal
   - Customer activation center
2. NotifyStack:
   - Campaign console
   - Transactional alert center
3. SignalLens:
   - Executive KPI dashboard
   - Growth analytics workspace
4. FlowBridge:
   - Workflow builder UI
   - Integration command center

## 7) Naming Upgrade Suggestions

Current names are usable. Better alternatives for stronger promotion:

Shopcore API:
1. `PulseCart Commerce Cloud API` (keep)
2. `CartForge Commerce API`
3. `NexaCart API Cloud`

Helpdesk API:
1. `HelpdeskFlow Support API` (keep)
2. `SupportOrbit API`
3. `ResolveDesk API`

Shopcore templates:
1. `Velora Boutique` (keep)
2. `PlayNest Toy` (keep)
3. `HavenHaus Furniture` (keep)
4. `LunaMuse Women` (keep)

Helpdesk templates:
1. `Assistly Ticket Desk` (rename option from Support Portal)
2. `CareGrid Message Desk` (keep)
3. `LivePulse Chat Desk` (rename option from Chat Support)
4. `AIDesk Copilot` (keep)

---

## 8) Non-Negotiable Execution Rules

1. No fake metrics in product or case study data.
2. Case studies must reference real product slugs and real configuration states.
3. Any frontend template must declare required API slug in metadata.
4. No product listing outside actual build-and-sell scope.
5. Ship fast, but keep catalog coherent and auditable.

---

## 9) Tracking Dashboard (Weekly)

Track these every week:
1. New API subscribers (Shopcore, Helpdesk)
2. Frontend template units sold
3. API churn and renewals
4. Demo -> paid conversion rate
5. Support ticket volume and resolution speed
6. Marketing spend vs closed revenue
